# Energy-Adaptive-Monitoring-for-Resilient-Smart-Farms
This project is called "Energy-Adaptive Monitoring for Resilient Smart Farms".

This project is based on the paper “An Attack-Resilient and Energy-Adaptive Monitoring System for Smart Farms” published in The 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), Dec. 2022 and the paper “Attack-Resistant, Energy-Adaptive Monitoring for Smart Farms: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach” accepted to IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

You can check the codes, papers, and slides in the corresponding subfolders.
